# Departure

## Request Pushback and Engine Start

Before you can begin taxiing, you need to request pushback from your parking position and start your engines. First, tune into the ground frequency provided with your IFR clearance. Depending on your position, you may need to make one of two types of requests.

If your position requires pushback, you can use the following request:
> Geneva Ground, Swiss 3PH, Stand 10, request pushback and engine start.

ATC will then approve your pushback and engine start and provide specific instructions on the direction you should face after pushback.

If pushback is not required, you can directly request engine start:
> Geneva Ground, Swiss 3PH, Stand 10, request engine start.

ATC will approve your engine start accordingly.

## Taxi to the Runway

Once pushback and engine start are complete, you need to request taxi clearance to the assigned runway. Use the following format for your request:
> Swiss 3PH, request taxi to runway 04.

ATC will provide you with a taxi route that you must read back to confirm:
> **Geneva Ground**: Swiss 3PH, runway 04 taxi via LINK 3, OUTER, G.  
> **Pilot**: Runway 04 via LINK 3, OUTER, G. Swiss 3PH.

If your route involves crossing other runways, you may initially receive instructions to a holding point:
> **Zurich Apron**: Swiss 3PH, runway 16 taxi via INNER, J, hold short runway 28.  
> **Pilot**: Runway 16 via INNER, J, hold short runway 28. Swiss 3PH.

When you reach the holding point, ATC will give you further instructions to cross any intersecting runways and continue to your assigned runway:
> **Zurich Apron**: Swiss 3PH, cross runway 28 at F, continue taxi via F, E, E2.  
> **Pilot**: Cross runway 28 at F, continue taxi via F, E, E2. Swiss 3PH.

As you approach the runway for departure, you will be instructed to contact the Tower for takeoff clearance.

## Requesting departure

When you arrive at the runway and are ready for departure, make the following request:
> Geneva Tower, Swiss 3PH, runway 04, ready for departure.

The Tower will provide you with takeoff clearance and any additional instructions. Acknowledge the clearance and prepare for takeoff as per their instructions.
> **Geneva Tower**: Swiss 3PH, Wind zero one at six, runway 04, cleared for takeoff  
> **Pilot**: Cleared for takeoff, runway 04. Swiss 3PH.

## Climb phase

Once you have taken off, you enter the climb phase, which involves ascending to your assigned altitude:

1. **Follow Departure Procedures:** Adhere to the assigned departure procedure (SID) and follow the route as specified in your clearance. 

2. **Communicate with ATC:** Follow any additional clearance or routing instructions provided by ATC to ensure a safe and efficient climb to cruising altitude.
