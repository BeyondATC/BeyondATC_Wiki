## Handoffs

As your flight progresses, you will be handed off from one air traffic control (ATC) sector to another. These handoffs are essential for maintaining continuous communication and ensuring that ATC tracks your aircraft’s position as you transition through different airspaces.

When a handoff is imminent, ATC will instruct you to change frequencies. The handoff might sound like this:

| Speaker                         | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :simple-tower: Zurich Departure | Swiss 3PH, contact Munich Radar 120.65.                                                    |
| :material-airplane: SWR3PH      | Contact Munich Radar 120.65, Swiss 3PH                                                     |


After switching to the new frequency, you should check in with the new controller by stating your current altitude and any other relevant details:

| Speaker                         | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :material-airplane: SWR3PH      | Munich Radar, Swiss 3PH, at flight level 350                                               |
| :simple-tower: Munich Radar     | Swiss 3PH, Munich Radar, identified                                                        |

## Descent planning

As you near your destination, it’s time to start planning your descent. Proper descent planning is important for ensuring a smooth transition from cruise altitude to your arrival at the airport.

### Calculating Top of descent (TOD)

To begin your descent at the optimal time, you need to calculate your Top of Descent (TOD). This is the point at which you should initiate your descent to reach the target altitude at the correct distance from the airport. A common rule of thumb for calculating TOD is to multiply the altitude you need to lose by 3. For example, if you're at 35,000 feet and need to descend to 10,000 feet, you need to lose 25,000 feet. Multiply 25 by 3, which gives you 75. This means you should start your descent approximately 75 nautical miles from the airport.

### Receiving descent clearance

ATC will typically inform you about your upcoming arrival a few nautical miles before your TOD. This might sound like:

| Speaker                         | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :simple-tower: Madrid Center    | Swiss 3PH, Madrid Center, expect INBO 1A, runway 02.                                       |

This information helps you plan your arrival and configure your aircraft for descent. As you get closer to your TOD, ATC will provide confirmation of your approach:

| Speaker                         | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :simple-tower: Madrid Center    | Swiss 3PH, INBO 1A, runway 02. Report ready for descent.                                   |

At this point, you have the option to begin your descent immediately or delay it based on your calculated TOD.

!!! warning
    As the pilot in command, **it is your responsibility to request descent when needed**. While ATC typically prompts you to descend, there may be times when they don't, or when their instruction comes later than you require. This can happen for several reasons, one being that ATC does not have precise knowledge of your TOD. The TOD is specific to your aircraft's performance and the descent planning you've calculated, which ATC cannot determine. Therefore, it’s essential to monitor your descent profile and, when necessary, report that you are ready for descent so ATC can issue the appropriate clearance.

ATC will guide your descent with step-down clearances until you reach the appropriate altitude for your approach.
