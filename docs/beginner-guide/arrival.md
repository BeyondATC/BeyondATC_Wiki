# Arrival

## Descent phase and approach

As you descend, refer to your arrival and approach charts to ensure you are following the correct procedures for your destination airport. These charts provide information such as speed restrictions, altitude constraints, and approach routes.

As you approach the airport, tune into the destination ATIS to gather the latest information for your arrival. The approach controller will expect you to report the ATIS identifier to confirm that you have the most up-to-date information:

| Speaker                        | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :material-airplane: SWR3PH     | Lisbon Approach, Swiss 3PH, good afternoon, FL168 with information Echo.                   |
| :simple-tower: Lisbon Approach | Swiss 3PH, Lisbon Approach, QNH 1019, expect the ILS 02 with the PESEX transition.         |

The approach controller will then provide you with specific approach instructions. You are expected to follow the assigned procedure. At some point, you may receive this clearance:

| Speaker                        | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :simple-tower: Lisbon Approach | Swiss 3PH, cleared direct PESEX, cross PESEX at or above 4,000, cleared ILS 02.            |

This clearance indicates that you should descend to PESEX, ensuring that you cross it at or above 4,000 feet, and then continue your descent toward the runway as per the approach procedure.

## Landing

After receiving clearance for your final approach, continue descending along the glide path and follow the approach procedure as instructed. Keep a close eye on your airspeed, altitude, and alignment with the runway, making adjustments as necessary to ensure a smooth approach.

As you near the runway, you'll receive landing clearance from the tower controller. This communication might sound like:

| Speaker                        | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :simple-tower: Lisbon Tower    | Swiss 3PH, Lisnbon Tower, wind 080 at 7 knots, runway 02, cleared to land.                 |
| :material-airplane: SWR3PH     | Runway 02 cleared to land, Swiss 3PH                                                       |

## Taxi to the gate

After landing, you will exit the runway as directed by the tower. The tower controller will give you instructions to vacate the runway and switch to ground frequency for taxi clearance to your gate:

| Speaker                        | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :simple-tower: Lisbon Tower    | Swiss 3PH, exit left at E1.                                                                |

Once you have exited the runway and are clear of any runway crossings, you will be asked to switch to the ground frequency and request taxi clearance to your assigned gate or parking position:

| Speaker                        | Response                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :material-airplane: SWR3PH     | Lisbon Ground, Swiss 3PH, vacated runway 02 at E1, request taxi to assigned gate.          |
| :simple-tower: Lisbon Ground   | Swiss 3PH, welcome to Lisbon, taxi to gate 25 via D, A1.                                   |
| :material-airplane: SWR3PH     | Taxi to gate 25 via D, A1, Swiss 3PH                                                       |

Follow the provided taxi route, paying close attention to any hold short instructions or crossing clearances you might receive along the way. 

Once you reach your gate, bring the aircraft to a complete stop, engage the parking brake, and shut down the engines. The ground crew will guide you into position, and your flight with BeyondATC is complete!
