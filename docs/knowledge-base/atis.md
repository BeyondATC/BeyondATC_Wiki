og_description: BeyondATC generates ATIS reports independently, relying on weather data (METAR) from aviationweather.gov (+ VATSIM as a second source) and available airport operations provided by the community. This system mimics how real-world controllers make decisions but does not aim to replicate real-time ATIS. This can lead to differences between the ATIS you receive from BeyondATC and the active runways information provided by real-world sources or flight planning tools like Simbrief or Navigraph.

# How ATIS works in BeyondATC

ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information at airports. It typically includes the current weather, active runways, available approaches, and any other relevant operational information for arriving and departing pilots.

The ATIS is **independently generated by BeyondATC and does not rely on real-world ATIS sourcesr**. It is based on live weather conditions and each airport‚Äôs defined SOP (Standard Operating Procedures) provided by the community. The goal is to simulate how a real-world controller might construct and announce an ATIS broadcast ‚Äî not to replicate real-time ATIS broadcasts word-for-word.

Because of this, BeyondATC's ATIS may differ from what you see in real-world tools or networks like Simbrief, Navigraph, or VATSIM. It reflects the runway and weather logic **used internally by BeyondATC**, ensuring full consistency between what the controller says and what the system executes.

## üå§Ô∏è Where ATIS data comes from

ATIS in BeyondATC is generated using:

- **METAR weather data** from [aviationweather.gov](https://aviationweather.gov)
- **VATSIM METAR** as a secondary source (fallback)
- **Airport SOP flows**, which define how runways are selected under specific wind, time, and aircraft conditions

The ATIS you receive will match the conditions and logic currently used by BeyondATC to control traffic at that airport.

---

## üõ´ How active runways are chosen

The runways broadcast in ATIS are determined by the same SOP system that governs all aircraft operations in BeyondATC.

Each SOP flow is defined with parameters such as:

- Wind direction and speed
- Time of day
- Day of the week
- Aircraft type (e.g. specific runways for heavy jets)

The system evaluates all defined flows and selects the most appropriate one based on current conditions. The resulting runway usage is then reflected in the ATIS message.

This ensures that pilots receive information that is 100% aligned with what BeyondATC is using internally to manage traffic.

## üîÅ Why ATIS may differ from Simbrief, Navigraph, or real life

### ‚û§ **Simbrief and other flight planning tools**

Simbrief and similar tools may base runway assignments on different data sources, such as forecasts, preset preferences, or historical data. These may not match the live METAR and SOP logic used in BeyondATC.

Additionally, other platforms (like Navigraph or real-world ATIS feeds) may reflect decisions made by real human controllers ‚Äî including temporary adjustments or preferences that BeyondATC is not aware of.

It‚Äôs important to remember that **runways are not part of a formal flight plan (OFP) in real-world operations**. They are assigned tactically by ATC based on current conditions. In both real life and BeyondATC, **the controller always has the final say**, and pilots are expected to follow those instructions even if they differ from what was pre-planned.

### ‚û§ **Real-world ATIS and active runways**

Real ATIS is controlled by live human ATC, which may:
- Override standard procedures
- Anticipate wind shifts
- Close runways temporarily
- Sequence based on real-time traffic conditions

BeyondATC can‚Äôt mirror these real-time decisions. It uses a fixed set of community-defined SOP rules that simulate realistic usage patterns, but don‚Äôt adapt dynamically to all real-world changes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current limitations

While BeyondATC‚Äôs ATIS system is built on solid logic, it still has a few limitations:

- There is **no access to real-time ATIS broadcasts** (BeyondATC generates its own based on current conditions)
- **Runway closures or temporary restrictions** are not modeled
- **Real-time NOTAMs and airport events** are not reflected
