# The use of squawk 1000 in Europe

Squawk 1000 is used between a few countries in Europe as part of a modernized air traffic management system. This code is specifically tied to the use of Mode S transponders which has the following benefits:

- **Unique identification**: Unlike traditional transponders, Mode S transponders transmit a unique 24-bit address for each aircraft, which serves as a digital fingerprint. This allows air traffic control systems to identify each aircraft without needing to rely on individual squawk codes.
- **Data-rich communication**: The Mode S transponder sends detailed information, such as the aircraft's altitude, position, speed, and flight ID, directly to ATC. This data is transmitted automatically and continuously, providing real-time updates.

Traditionally, aircraft are assigned different squawk codes to differentiate them on radar. However, with Mode S transponders, each aircraft is already uniquely identified through its transponder data. Squawk 1000 acts as a placeholder, indicating to the ATC system that the aircraft's Mode S transponder is providing all the necessary information.

**Countries using squawk 1000**

- Austria
- Belgium
- Croatia
- Czech Republic
- France
- Germany
- Hungary
- Italy
- Luxembourg
- Netherlands
- Poland
- Romania
- Slovakia
- Switzerland (LSZR,LSZB,LSZG,LSGC,LSZH,LSGG)

**This behavior is modeled in BeyondATC**. Therefore, you will be assigned squawk 1000 if you are flying between these countries.
