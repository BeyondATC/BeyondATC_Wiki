# Getting Started with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and BeyondATC  

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is here, and we know many of you are excited to experience BeyondATC in this brand-new simulator! We’re happy to confirm that **BeyondATC is fully compatible with MSFS 2024**. This guide will walk you through the current limitations and how to configure your simulator for the best experience with BeyondATC.  

## Known Issues  

Before diving in, **please review the following known limitations when using BeyondATC with MSFS 2024**:  

- **Traffic Model Issues**:  
    - **FSLTL and AIG Models**: The current MSFS 2024 build has known issues with animations and lights for FSLTL and AIG traffic models. Both teams are actively working on fixes.  
    - **FSLTL Chirping Sound**: In external views, FSLTL models may produce a chirping sound, as if aircraft are continuously landing. This issue is being investigated.  

- **SimConnect Connection**: If you navigate to the MSFS menus while using BeyondATC, it will lose connection. This is due to changes in how SimConnect is handled in MSFS 2024.  

- **Included Traffic Models**:  
    - The new traffic models included with MSFS 2024 currently do not support external injection outside of the simulator’s default traffic engine. We are investigating this further, but as of now, they may not be usable by third-party applications. Updates will follow as we learn more.  

## Setting Up MSFS2024  

### Disable AI Traffic  

To ensure compatibility with BeyondATC, disable AI traffic as follows:  

1. **Settings > General > Graphics**  
    - Traffic Airport Quality: **OFF**  
    - Air Traffic: **OFF**  

2. **Settings > General > Online**  
    - Aircraft Traffic Type: **OFF**  
    - Multiplayer: **OFF**  

3. **Settings > VR > VR Graphics**  
    - Traffic Airport Quality: **OFF**  
    - Air Traffic: **OFF**  

**If AI aircraft are still visible around the airport**:  

- Return to the main menu and start a new flight.  
- Revisit each setting, scroll through to **OFF**, and save changes after resetting them.  

### Disable Default ATC  

Follow these steps to disable the default ATC:  

1. **Settings > Accessibility**  
    - Turn Subtitles: **OFF**  

2. **Settings > Assistance** (under Realism)  
    - AI Radio Communications (ATC): **OFF**  
    - ATC Enforce Flight Plan: **OFF**  

3. **Settings > General > Sound**  
    - Set Character Voice to **0**  

### Traffic Models  

BeyondATC requires third-party traffic models to function. These models must be installed in the simulator’s community folder. Make sure they are correctly placed in the new MSFS2024 directory.  

Here’s the default location of the community folder for MSFS2024:  

- **Steam version**:  
  `C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024\Packages\Community`  

- **Microsoft Store version**:  
  `C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Limitless_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Packages\Community`  

!!! info "Using MSFS Addons Linker"  
    To avoid managing two separate addon locations and duplicating files, use **MSFS Addons Linker**, which now supports MSFS2024. This tool lets you store all your addons in one folder, no matter which simulator you launch. You can download it here: [MSFS Addons Linker](https://flightsim.to/file/1572/msfs-addons-linker).
