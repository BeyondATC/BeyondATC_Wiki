# 🛠️ BeyondATC Support & Bug Reporting

Welcome to the official guide on how support works for BeyondATC. This page is designed to give you a clear understanding of:

- ✅ How to report issues and where to do it  
- 🚫 What support does *not* include  
- 💡 What makes a good report  

---

## 📌 How support works

Support for BeyondATC is **community-driven and development-focused**, not a traditional help desk.

That means:

- There is **no ticketing system**, and **you may not get a personal response** every time you publish a message.
- Devs **do read bug reports** — but their time is spent on investigation and fixes, not answering every message.
- Moderators, support staff and community members often help with **troubleshooting and guidance**, especially in the `#batc-support` channel.
- Bug reports that are **logged in the correct forum threads** are reviewed and used during development and testing.

> **Note:**  
> If you're expecting direct tech support or a guaranteed fix timeframe, this may not match your expectations. But if you want to contribute to a growing and evolving product, your reports *do* make a difference — even if you never hear back.

## 🧭 Understanding the Discord Support flow

The BeyondATC Discord uses different spaces for different needs. Here's how to navigate them effectively:

| 🧩 Situation                                  | ✅ Where to Post               | ❌ Where *Not* to Post                    |
|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Need help understanding an error or feature  | `#batc-support` channel          | General discussion or unrelated threads   |
| Found a bug during a flight                  | Relevant support forum thread    | `#batc-support` or casual discussions     |
| Want to give feedback or suggest improvements| Discussions channels or the [Nolt platform](https://beyondatc.nolt.io) | Random comments in unrelated threads      |

**Support threads** are organized by category (e.g. Departures issues”, “Vectoring”, “Traffic movement”) and are the **primary place** where devs look for:

- Log files  
- Reproduction steps  
- Patterns across reports  
- Verification after a fix is deployed

Think of these threads as **categorized bug tracking**, not conversation spaces.

## 📄 What makes a report useful?

You don’t have to write an essay. A good report is about clarity, not length.

Include:

- What happened (in plain terms)
- What you expected instead
- When and where it happened (phase of flight, airport, etc.)
- Steps to reproduce (if known)
- Your **log file** – this is vital for devs
- Optionally: a screenshot, short video, or clip

> 💡 The goal isn’t to be perfect — it’s to provide enough context for devs to trace, understand and reproduce the issue.

Log files are very important in helping us identify the root cause of the issue. Please upload your log files along with your bug report. The logs contain detailed information about BeyondATC operations, such as errors that occurred during your session, flight plan used and the full history of your flight.

Navigate to the log files on your computer:  
```%userprofile%\appdata\locallow\Skirmish Mode Games, Inc\BeyondATC```

Find the following files in that directory:

- ```Player.log```: contains the log from your most recent flight. If the issue occurred during your last flight, please upload this log.
- ```Player-prev.log```: contains the log from the flight preceding your most recent one. If you completed another flight after encountering the issue, please send this log instead
- ```beyondATC.log```: This log provides insights into the BeyondATC application’s operations. If this file is not empty, please include it with your report.

## ❓ What to expect (realistically)

We want to set the right expectations. Here's what you *can* and *cannot* expect from reporting:

| ✅ You can expect...                           | ❌ You should not expect...                    |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| That your report will be seen and considered   | A reply to every report or bug confirmation    |
| That forum threads are reviewed regularly      | That your issue will be prioritized instantly  |
| That bugs are tracked and fixed over time      | Immediate hotfixes for every report            |
| That reporting helps improve the product       | Personalized support or 1:1 conversations for every issue     |

> ⚠️ **Silence ≠ Ignorance**  
> A lack of response doesn’t mean your report is ignored. Devs prioritize work based on severity, frequency, complexity, and available data.

## 🤝 Conclusion

BeyondATC support is built on **shared responsibility**:

- The devs focus on building and fixing  
- Mods, support staff and community members help organize and guide  
- Users can contribute — but aren’t obligated to  
- Discord is the hub — but only if used correctly  

We may not reply to every post. We may not fix your bug right away. But every clear, helpful report builds a better product — not just for you, but for thousands of others.
