# How to report bugs

When encountering issues with BeyondATC, providing a clear and detailed bug report will help the developers team to diagnose and patch the problem. Below are guidelines to help you create a useful bug report.

## Where to report bugs
For bug reporting, please use our Discord channel *?!-batc-support*. Here, both our team and community members are available to assist with troubleshooting steps and provide guidance. When reporting a bug, please ensure that your information is clear, concise, and includes the necessary details to reproduce the issue.

## How to write a bug report
To help us understand and resolve the problem, please include the following details in your bug report:

- **Summary**: Provide a brief description of the issue. This should be a concise statement that clearly explains the problem.
- **Steps to reproduce**: If applicable, outline the steps that you took leading up to the issue. Be as specific as possible so that we can replicate the problem on our end.
- **Expected result**: Describe what you expected to happen when you followed the steps above.

!!! tip "Additional tips for reporting bugs"
    Include any other element that can help to understand the issue. For example, you can send a flight tracking map from Volanta to illustrate a problem with flight instructions.

## Uploading log files
Log files are very important in helping us identify the root cause of the issue. Please upload your log files along with your bug report. The logs contain detailed information about BATC operations, such as errors that occurred during your session, flight plan used and the full history of your flight.

Navigate to the log files on your computer:  
```%userprofile%\appdata\locallow\Skirmish Mode Games, Inc\BeyondATC```

Find the following files in that directory:

- ```Player.log```: contains the log from your most recent flight. If the issue occurred during your last flight, please upload this log.
- ```Player-prev.log```: contains the log from the flight preceding your most recent one. If you completed another flight after encountering the issue, please send this log instead
- ```beyondATC.log```: This log provides insights into the BeyondATC applicationâ€™s operations. If this file is not empty, please include it with your report.

Drag and drop these files directly into the Discord channel.

Mention your bug report when uploading the logs so that our team can correlate the log data with your specific issue.
