- üß† Ask your questions freely ‚Äî no need to worry whether it‚Äôs ‚Äúimportant enough‚Äù.  
- üõ†Ô∏è Mods, experienced users, and community members regularly assist with troubleshooting.  
- ‚ùå It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs a bug ‚Äî just describe the issue.

> üí¨ **While we can't guarantee an immediate answer, you're never bothering anyone by asking. This is the place to learn and get help. If you did not receive any response after a few hours, you are free to ask again.**

## üìÑ How to get your log files

Log files are very important in helping us identify the root cause of the issue. Please upload your log files along with your bug report. The logs contain detailed information about BeyondATC operations, such as errors that occurred during your session, flight plan used and the full history of your flight.

Navigate to the log files on your computer:  
```%userprofile%\appdata\locallow\Skirmish Mode Games, Inc\BeyondATC```

Find the following files in that directory:

- ```Player.log```: contains the log from your most recent flight. If the issue occurred during your last flight, please upload this log.
- ```Player-prev.log```: contains the log from the flight preceding your most recent one. If you completed another flight after encountering the issue, please send this log instead
- ```beyondATC.log```: This log provides insights into the BeyondATC application‚Äôs operations. If this file is not empty, please include it with your report.
