If BeyondATC can't connect to the simulator, please follow the steps from each section. If it doesn't work at the end of a section, follow to the next one.

## Start BeyondATC as designed

1. Start your simulator. MSFS should be running and you should be at least in the main menu. Preferably, you should be already on the ground at your departure airport.
2. Start BeyondATC, make sure you have a flight plan ready in Simbrief and click Fly.

## Simconnect

1. Close MSFS and BeyondATC.
2. Check your task manager and make sure that no simconnect_ws.exe is running. If this process is still running, kill it.
3. Start your simulator and BeyondATC

## Security softwares

Ensure that your antivirus, firewall and/or Windows Security are not blocking BeyondATC to connect to the internet, or are blocking any of its file. Do not forget to check the quarantine. If any file is quarantined, restore it and add an exception to the whole BeyondATC folder.

## Privileges

If BeyondATC still fails to connect, run the software as an administrator.

## PC issue

Some issues can be specific to a session. Try to close everything and restart your computer.

## Workaround

If you still have persistent issues, try the following:

1. While BeyondATC is opened, come back to the MSFS main menu and click Fly.
2. BeyondATC should say *The connection to the simulator has been lost*
3. Spawn into the airport and when ready, click Fly again.

## ISP issues

There might be issues related to your ISP. Users from Turkey and Hong Kong had issues connecting to BeyondATC servers. If you can, try using a VPN and launch BeyondATC again.

## Reinstalling BeyondATC

If none of these solutions worked, try to uninstall BeyondATC. Make sure to delete the BeyondATC folder in ```%userprofile%\appdata\locallow\Skirmish Mode Games, Inc\```. Download BeyondATC from the website and run the installer.
