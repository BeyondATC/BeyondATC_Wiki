This is the point at which you should initiate your descent to reach the target altitude at the correct distance from the airport. A common rule of thumb for calculating TOD is to multiply the altitude you need to lose by 3. For example, if you're at 35,000 feet and need to descend to 10,000 feet, you need to lose 25,000 feet. Multiply 25 by 3, which gives you 75.

This includes information on weather, runway in use and other important updates. ATIS broadcasts are updated regularly to reflect the latest conditions and are crucial for planning your approach and departure.</p> <p>To listen to the ATIS broadcast in BeyondATC:</p> <ol> <li>Tune into the ATIS Frequency: You can find the ATIS frequency on charts or you can tune it by clicking on the headphone icon and selecting the frequency.</li> <li>Listen Carefully: Pay attention to the broadcasted information, which will include a letter code designating the current ATIS message (e.g., ATIS Information Alpha, Bravo, etc.).</li> <li>Note Key Details: Take note of the weather conditions, active runways, and any special instructions provided in the ATIS broadcast.</li> </ol> <p>Replay the ATIS broadcast</p> <p>You can listen to the ATIS broadcast as many times as needed, so don't worry if you miss any information initially. Take your time to ensure you capture all the details. For users with Premium Characters, the ATIS broadcast is generated once and then continuously looped. Replaying the broadcast will not consume additional Premium Characters.</p> <p>Here is an example of an ATIS broadcast: </p> ATIS Broadcast Geneva Airport Information Oscar. One eight two four zulu.

Transition level zero seven zero. Numerous cranes in operation around Geneva. Advise on initial contact you have information Oscar. Understand the ATIS Broadcast Information Explanation Information Oscar This letter indicates the current ATIS information. ATIS messages are updated periodically, with each new message assigned a sequential letter. Make a note of this letter as you will need to inform ATC that you have this information when asking for IFR clearance. Time (One eight two four zulu) This is the time when the ATIS was last updated, given in UTC (Zulu) time. Knowing the time helps you gauge how current the information is. Wind (Wind zero one at six) The wind is coming from 010 degrees at 6 knots. This information is crucial for understanding the wind direction and strength for takeoff and landing. Clouds (Few clouds at six thousand four hundred) This indicates that there are a few clouds at 6,400 feet above ground level. This helps in assessing the visibility and potential weather conditions you might encounter. Temperature (Temperature one eight) The air temperature is 18\u00b0C. Temperature affects aircraft performance, including takeoff and landing distances. Dewpoint (Dewpoint zero six) The dewpoint is 6\u00b0C. The dewpoint helps determine the likelihood of fog or other weather phenomena. QNH (QNH one zero one six) This is the atmospheric pressure at sea level, measured in millibars (1016 mb). Set this on your altimeter to ensure accurate altitude readings in your aircraft. Runway Information (Landing and departing runway zero four) The active runway for landing and departure is Runway 04. This information is important for planning your approach and departure. Transition Level (Transition level zero seven zero) This is the altitude above which you should use standard pressure (1013 mb) for altitude assignments. Below this level, local pressure settings are used. Special Notices (Numerous cranes in operation around Geneva) This includes any hazards or special conditions, such as construction or wildlife activities that might affect your flight. <p>What to Listen For:</p> <ol> <li>ATIS information letter: Note the letter in the ATIS broadcast. You need to communicate to ATC that you have this specific information.</li> <li>Weather conditions: Pay close attention to wind, clouds, temperature, and pressure.

However, to keep the program affordable we do not use a LLM (Large Language Model) such as Gemini or ChatGPT.</p> Do I need a Navigraph subscription to use BeyondATC? <p>You don\u2019t need a Navigraph subscription to use BeyondATC. The software pulls information directly from your simulator, including airport data, approaches, waypoints, and more, using the scenery and AIRAC cycle already available in your sim. However, if you generate a flight plan in Simbrief using a different AIRAC cycle than what\u2019s in your simulator, you may encounter specific discrepancies.</p> <p>If desired, you can opt for a one-month Navigraph subscription to update both your simulator and Simbrief with the latest AIRAC cycle, ensuring everything is synchronized to the same source.</p>"},{"location":"support/faq/#atc-questions","title":"ATC questions","text":"Why am I regularly getting Squawk 1000? <p>Squawk 1000 is used between a few countries in Europe as part of a modernized air traffic management system. This code is specifically tied to the use of Mode S transponders, which provide detailed aircraft information, such as position and unique identifier, directly to air traffic controllers. Unlike traditional squawk codes, which require different codes for different flights, squawk 1000 simplifies the process by standardizing the code for all aircraft equipped with Mode S.</p> <p>Countries Using Squawk 1000</p> <ul> <li>Austria</li> <li>Belgium</li> <li>Croatia</li> <li>Czech Republic</li> <li>France</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>Hungary</li> <li>Italy</li> <li>Luxembourg</li> <li>Netherlands</li> <li>Poland</li> <li>Romania</li> <li>Slovakia</li> <li>Switzerland (LSZR,LSZB,LSZG,LSGC,LSZH,LSGG)</li> </ul> <p>This behavior is modeled in BeyondATC. Therefore, you will be assigned squawk 1000 if you are flying between these countries.</p> <p>For more info:</p> <ul> <li>https://forums.vatsim.net/topic/27699-squawk-1000/</li> <li>https://www.pprune.org/atc-issues/484742-squawk-1000-a.html</li> <li>https://skybrary.aero/articles/mode-s</li> </ul> Why BeyondATC makes me use a runway that is not active in real life? <p>BeyondATC generates ATIS reports independently, relying on weather data (METAR) from aviationweather.gov (+ VATSIM as a second source) and available airport operations provided by the community. This system mimics how real-world controllers make decisions but does not aim to replicate real-time ATIS. This can lead to differences between the ATIS you receive from BATC and the active runways information provided by real-world sources or flight planning tools like Simbrief or Navigraph.</p> <p>These differences will be minimized in the future thanks to more complex airports operations. Currently, BATC's airports SOPs are basic. They include:</p> <ul> <li>Preferential low wind runways used for departures and arrivals (based on a low-wind threshold)</li> <li>Defined runways for departures and/or arrivals</li> </ul> <p>Advanced features such as curfews, time-based runway changes, or direction-specific runway assignments are not yet implemented. </p> Should ATC instruct me when I have to descend? <p>As the pilot in command, it is your responsibility to request descent when needed. While ATC typically prompts you to descend, there may be times when they don't, or when their instruction comes later than you require. This can happen for several reasons, one being that ATC does not have precise knowledge of your TOD. The TOD is specific to your aircraft's performance and the descent planning you've calculated, which ATC cannot determine. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to monitor your descent profile and, when necessary, report that you are ready for descent so ATC can issue the appropriate clearance.</p> <p>You can read our Beginner Guide about descent planning if you need help.</p> Why isn't BeyondATC using the runway specified in my flight plan? <p>In real-world aviation, runways are not pre-assigned in flight plans. Instead, they are determined by Air Traffic Control (ATC) based on current conditions like wind direction, runway availability, and traffic volume.</p> <p>SimBrief provides a suggested runway based on standard conditions at the time of planning, but the actual runway assignment can change when you\u2019re closer to your departure or arrival. BeyondATC simulates this real-world ATC behavior by assigning runways dynamically, just as in actual flight operations.</p>"},{"location":"support/faq/#ai-traffic","title":"AI Traffic","text":"What should I expect from AI Traffic? <p>Traffic is currently available in alpha, this means its a really early version of the traffic product. We believe it will give you plenty of enjoyment in its current state but there will be issues, there may be crashes of BATC and features may be missing. If you find traffic in its current state does not enhance your experience, you can disable it from within the options menu or alternatively if you find the build unstable, switch back the core EA version from your accounts page.</p> <p>We would greatly appreciate if you could send your reports, including log files and any other relevant information asked in the thread, in \u2060traffic-alpha-feedback. Your patience and understanding are invaluable as the dev team work on improving this feature.</p> How can I get AI Traffic with BeyondATC? <p>AI traffic is available for supporters only. To access this feature, you need to upgrade from the basic pack to the supporter pack for $29.99. Supporters can activate the experimental branch in the account section in BeyondATC.</p> <p>Traffic will be available to everyone (basic pack) later at no extra cost.</p> What is the traffic source? <p>BeyondATC uses data from FlightRadar24, using a historic week of data. This includes all IFR flights, GA included. </p> Why are you not using live traffic? Are you planning to add it later? <p>Various factors were evaluated such as costs, contracts, user feedback, system architecture, and development timeline. Based on these criteria, the choice was made not to use live traffic data.</p> <p>Tests showed minimal differences that most users won't notice. This setup offers a seamless experience without the complexities and costs of live traffic, allowing users to choose their flight times and experience busy airports.</p> <p>Currently, there are no plans to implement live traffic or support any other injectors. </p> Which models will BeyondATC use for AI Traffic? <p>BeyondATC will use whatever models you have installed in your simulator, including any combination of AIG, FSLTL, and FS Traffic.</p> Can AI traffic use ground services? <p>Currently, AI traffic cannot use ground services or jetways due to how BeyondATC injects its traffic. Implementing this would require BeyondATC to inject its own pushback tug into the simulator, which might be considered later as an update. Keep in mind that the dev team will focus on core features before considering cosmetic enhancements. </p> What features are available with AI Traffic? <ul> <li>Traffic data for the globe based on live traffic from an historic week of data, limited to any aircraft flying IFR with an active transponder</li> <li>Ground, departure, arrival traffic to and from the airports you have planned in Simbrief for your flight</li> <li>Traffic fully managed by Beyond ATC including parking, runway and procedure assignments</li> <li>Parking spots represent the actual parking spot of the aircraft in real life, irrespective of the parking assignments in the airport scenery</li> <li>Support for FSLTL, AIG and FS Traffic models - at least one of which must be installed</li> <li>Initial separation handling of aircraft at injection</li> <li>Ability to use premium, basic or turn off voices entirely for traffic, separately from the voice setting being used for your the player.</li> <li>Traffic managed by ATC out to 200nm from the player even without those aircraft having to be present in the simulator, saving valuable sim resources.</li> <li>A slider that limits traffic based on a time range from our data set - the higher the slider, the further out the time range.</li> </ul> What features will come in future builds for AI Traffic? <ul> <li>Enroute traffic not flying to or from either of the airports you have planned.</li> <li>Any ground services, in particular a tug for pushback</li> <li>Full separation handling through the entire traffic aircraft flight</li> <li>Continued improvements to handling procedures</li> </ul> What features are available with AI Traffic? <ul> <li>Aircraft might float while on the ground at certain airports or with certain models</li> <li>Aircraft may follow strange flight plans</li> <li>Aircraft may enter the runway at the wrong point</li> <li>Aircraft may turn off abruptly or too fast from the runway on landing</li> <li>Aircraft may taxi through other parked aircraft at ramps that allow taxi through</li> <li>Aircraft may land too close together</li> <li>Aircraft may get stuck handing over to ground from tower on landing</li> <li>BATC may crash with fatal errors</li> </ul> How do I set up everything to use traffic with BeyondATC? <p>Please follow our setup guide here</p> How does the slider work? <p>The slider controls the time range for aircraft parked at the gates. A setting of 1 represents a short time range, while 10 represents a longer one. The higher the slider value, the more aircraft will be parked at the gates.
