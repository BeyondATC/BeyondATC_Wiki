This is the point at which you should initiate your descent to reach the target altitude at the correct distance from the airport. A common rule of thumb for calculating TOD is to multiply the altitude you need to lose by 3. For example, if you're at 35,000 feet and need to descend to 10,000 feet, you need to lose 25,000 feet. Multiply 25 by 3, which gives you 75.

Take your time to ensure you capture all the details. For users with Premium Characters, the ATIS broadcast is generated once and then continuously looped. Replaying the broadcast will not consume additional Premium Characters.</p> <p>Breaking down the ATIS broadcast:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Information Oscar: This letter indicates the current ATIS information.

This information is crucial for understanding the wind direction and strength for takeoff and landing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clouds (Few clouds at six thousand four hundred): This indicates that there are a few clouds at 6,400 feet above ground level. This helps in assessing the visibility and potential weather conditions you might encounter.</p> </li> <li> <p>Temperature (Temperature one eight): The air temperature is 18\u00b0C. Temperature affects aircraft performance, including takeoff and landing distances.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dewpoint (Dewpoint zero six): The dewpoint is 6\u00b0C. The dewpoint helps determine the likelihood of fog or other weather phenomena.</p> </li> <li> <p>QNH (QNH one zero one six): This is the atmospheric pressure at sea level, measured in millibars (1016 mb). Set this on your altimeter to ensure accurate altitude readings in your aircraft.</p> </li> <li> <p>Runway Information (Landing and departing runway zero four): The active runway for landing and departure is Runway 04. This information is important for planning your approach and departure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transition Level (Transition level zero seven zero): This is the altitude above which you should use standard pressure (1013 mb) for altitude assignments.

This approach enables users to participate in the final development stages by providing feedback, reporting bugs, and suggesting improvements. In return, users get a chance to explore new features ahead of the final release.</p> <p>This means if you purchase BeyondATC, you are getting a program still under development. This program will include bugs and strange behavior. Please make sure you understand this before making your purchase decision.</p> How much does BeyondATC cost? <p>The basic pack is priced at $29.99. This pack includes all core features, with no additional purchases required unless you choose to buy Premium Characters for enhanced voice options. Additionally, a Supporter Pack is available for $59.99, granting access to the experimental branch where new features are introduced first for testing.</p> <p>For detailed information on pricing and available options, please visit our pricing page.</p> Is BeyondATC a one-time purchase? <p>Yes! BeyondATC comes with a large amount of Premium Characters included in the base purchase (about an hour of speaking time), and that is yours to use from the moment you purchase the product. However, you are not required to use this voice model at all. The product works entirely from start to finish with the Basic Voice Model, and requires no additional purchases of any kind. Additionally, it will include all future updates and upcoming features!</p> Does BeyondATC require an active internet connection? <p>Yes, our voices use cloud-based technology and require an active connection to work.</p> Which simulators is BeyondATC be available for? <p>BeyondATC is currently designed for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and is also planned to support the upcoming 2024 edition.</p> <p>We have not planned to support any other simulator.</p> Is there a trial period? <p>We do not offer a trial period at this stage. You can search for BeyondATC videos and review to make your decision.</p> Is BeyondATC powered by AI? <p>We use the latest in AI technologies to process your voice, decide what the ATC should do, and generate highly realistic responses with AI voices. However, to keep the program affordable we do not use a LLM (Large Language Model) such as Gemini or ChatGPT.</p>"},{"location":"support/faq/#atc-questions","title":"ATC questions","text":"Why am I regularly getting Squawk 1000? <p>Squawk 1000 is used between a few countries in Europe as part of a modernized air traffic management system. This code is specifically tied to the use of Mode S transponders, which provide detailed aircraft information, such as position and unique identifier, directly to air traffic controllers. Unlike traditional squawk codes, which require different codes for different flights, squawk 1000 simplifies the process by standardizing the code for all aircraft equipped with Mode S.</p> <p>Countries Using Squawk 1000</p> <ul> <li>Austria</li> <li>Belgium</li> <li>Croatia</li> <li>Czech Republic</li> <li>France</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>Hungary</li> <li>Italy</li> <li>Luxembourg</li> <li>Netherlands</li> <li>Poland</li> <li>Romania</li> <li>Slovakia</li> <li>Switzerland (LSZR,LSZB,LSZG,LSGC,LSZH,LSGG)</li> </ul> <p>This behavior is modeled in BeyondATC. Therefore, you will be assigned squawk 1000 if you are flying between these countries.</p> <p>For more info:</p> <ul> <li>https://forums.vatsim.net/topic/27699-squawk-1000/</li> <li>https://www.pprune.org/atc-issues/484742-squawk-1000-a.html</li> <li>https://skybrary.aero/articles/mode-s</li> </ul> Why BeyondATC makes me use a runway that is not active in real life? <p>BeyondATC generates ATIS reports independently, relying on weather data (METAR) from aviationweather.gov (+ VATSIM as a second source) and available airport operations provided by the community. This system mimics how real-world controllers make decisions but does not aim to replicate real-time ATIS. This can lead to differences between the ATIS you receive from BATC and the active runways information provided by real-world sources or flight planning tools like Simbrief or Navigraph.</p> <p>These differences will be minimized in the future thanks to more complex airports operations. Currently, BATC's airports SOPs are basic. They include:</p> <ul> <li>Preferential low wind runways used for departures and arrivals (based on a low-wind threshold)</li> <li>Defined runways for departures and/or arrivals</li> </ul> <p>Advanced features such as curfews, time-based runway changes, or direction-specific runway assignments are not yet implemented. </p> Should ATC instruct me when I have to descend? <p>As the pilot in command, it is your responsibility to request descent when needed. While ATC typically prompts you to descend, there may be times when they don't, or when their instruction comes later than you require. This can happen for several reasons, one being that ATC does not have precise knowledge of your TOD. The TOD is specific to your aircraft's performance and the descent planning you've calculated, which ATC cannot determine. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to monitor your descent profile and, when necessary, report that you are ready for descent so ATC can issue the appropriate clearance.</p> <p>You can read our Beginner Guide about descent planning if you need help.</p>"},{"location":"support/faq/#troubleshooting-issues","title":"Troubleshooting issues","text":"Why can't I type anything in the Simbrief ID field? <p>Make sure you are typing your Pilot ID and not your username.
