Transition level zero seven zero. Numerous cranes in operation around Geneva. Advise on initial contact you have information Oscar. Understand the ATIS Broadcast Information Explanation Information Oscar This letter indicates the current ATIS information. ATIS messages are updated periodically, with each new message assigned a sequential letter. Make a note of this letter as you will need to inform ATC that you have this information when asking for IFR clearance. Time (One eight two four zulu) This is the time when the ATIS was last updated, given in UTC (Zulu) time. Knowing the time helps you gauge how current the information is. Wind (Wind zero one at six) The wind is coming from 010 degrees at 6 knots. This information is crucial for understanding the wind direction and strength for takeoff and landing. Clouds (Few clouds at six thousand four hundred) This indicates that there are a few clouds at 6,400 feet above ground level. This helps in assessing the visibility and potential weather conditions you might encounter. Temperature (Temperature one eight) The air temperature is 18\u00b0C. Temperature affects aircraft performance, including takeoff and landing distances. Dewpoint (Dewpoint zero six) The dewpoint is 6\u00b0C. The dewpoint helps determine the likelihood of fog or other weather phenomena. QNH (QNH one zero one six) This is the atmospheric pressure at sea level, measured in millibars (1016 mb). Set this on your altimeter to ensure accurate altitude readings in your aircraft. Runway Information (Landing and departing runway zero four) The active runway for landing and departure is Runway 04. This information is important for planning your approach and departure. Transition Level (Transition level zero seven zero) This is the altitude above which you should use standard pressure (1013 mb) for altitude assignments. Below this level, local pressure settings are used. Special Notices (Numerous cranes in operation around Geneva) This includes any hazards or special conditions, such as construction or wildlife activities that might affect your flight. <p>What to Listen For:</p> <ol> <li>ATIS information letter: Note the letter in the ATIS broadcast.

This code is specifically tied to the use of Mode S transponders, which provide detailed aircraft information, such as position and unique identifier, directly to air traffic controllers. Unlike traditional squawk codes, which require different codes for different flights, squawk 1000 simplifies the process by standardizing the code for all aircraft equipped with Mode S.</p> <p>Countries Using Squawk 1000</p> <ul> <li>Austria</li> <li>Belgium</li> <li>Croatia</li> <li>Czech Republic</li> <li>France</li> <li>Germany</li> <li>Hungary</li> <li>Italy</li> <li>Luxembourg</li> <li>Netherlands</li> <li>Poland</li> <li>Romania</li> <li>Slovakia</li> <li>Switzerland (LSZR,LSZB,LSZG,LSGC,LSZH,LSGG)</li> </ul> <p>This behavior is modeled in BeyondATC. Therefore, you will be assigned squawk 1000 if you are flying between these countries.</p> <p>For more info:</p> <ul> <li>https://forums.vatsim.net/topic/27699-squawk-1000/</li> <li>https://www.pprune.org/atc-issues/484742-squawk-1000-a.html</li> <li>https://skybrary.aero/articles/mode-s</li> </ul> Why BeyondATC makes me use a runway that is not active in real life? <p>BeyondATC generates ATIS reports independently, relying on weather data (METAR) from aviationweather.gov (+ VATSIM as a second source) and available airport operations provided by the community. This system mimics how real-world controllers make decisions but does not aim to replicate real-time ATIS. This can lead to differences between the ATIS you receive from BATC and the active runways information provided by real-world sources or flight planning tools like Simbrief or Navigraph.</p> <p>These differences will be minimized in the future thanks to more complex airports operations. Currently, BATC's airports SOPs are basic. They include:</p> <ul> <li>Preferential low wind runways used for departures and arrivals (based on a low-wind threshold)</li> <li>Defined runways for departures and/or arrivals</li> </ul> <p>Advanced features such as curfews, time-based runway changes, or direction-specific runway assignments are not yet implemented. </p> Should ATC instruct me when I have to descend? <p>As the pilot in command, it is your responsibility to request descent when needed. While ATC typically prompts you to descend, there may be times when they don't, or when their instruction comes later than you require. This can happen for several reasons, one being that ATC does not have precise knowledge of your TOD. The TOD is specific to your aircraft's performance and the descent planning you've calculated, which ATC cannot determine. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to monitor your descent profile and, when necessary, report that you are ready for descent so ATC can issue the appropriate clearance.</p> <p>You can read our Beginner Guide about descent planning if you need help.</p> Why isn't BeyondATC using the runway specified in my flight plan? <p>In real-world aviation, runways are not pre-assigned in flight plans. Instead, they are determined by Air Traffic Control (ATC) based on current conditions like wind direction, runway availability, and traffic volume.</p> <p>SimBrief provides a suggested runway based on standard conditions at the time of planning, but the actual runway assignment can change when you\u2019re closer to your departure or arrival. BeyondATC simulates this real-world ATC behavior by assigning runways dynamically, just as in actual flight operations.</p> Why is BeyondATC directing me to use incorrect taxiways? <p>BeyondATC relies on airport scenery data for taxiway routing, but currently, it doesn't use taxiway width information. This is because, in both third-party and default sceneries, taxiway sizing is often inaccurate or inconsistently defined. Attempting to use this incomplete data would likely lead to more routing issues, so BeyondATC focuses on the best available information without relying on potentially unreliable taxiway width data.</p>"},{"location":"support/faq/#ai-traffic","title":"AI Traffic","text":"What is the traffic source? <p>BeyondATC uses data from FlightRadar24, using a historic week of data. This includes all IFR flights, GA included. </p> Why are you not using live traffic? Are you planning to add it later? <p>Various factors were evaluated such as costs, contracts, user feedback, system architecture, and development timeline. Based on these criteria, the choice was made not to use live traffic data.</p> <p>Tests showed minimal differences that most users won't notice. This setup offers a seamless experience without the complexities and costs of live traffic, allowing users to choose their flight times and experience busy airports.</p> <p>Currently, there are no plans to implement live traffic or support any other injectors. </p> Which models will BeyondATC use for AI Traffic? <p>BeyondATC will use whatever models you have installed in your simulator, including any combination of AIG, FSLTL, and FS Traffic.</p> BeyondATC says that no traffic liveries are found <p>Make sure you have installed models for at least one provider (AIG, FSLTL or FS Traffic) in the community folder of the MSFS version you are using. If it still doesn't work, start BeyondATC as an administrator.</p> Can BeyondATC use the new traffic models that come with MSFS 2024? <p>The new traffic models included with MSFS 2024 currently do not support external injection outside of the simulator\u2019s default traffic engine. We are investigating this further, but as of now, they may not be usable by third-party applications. Updates will follow as we learn more.</p> Can AI traffic use ground services? <p>Currently, AI traffic cannot use ground services or jetways due to how BeyondATC injects its traffic. Implementing this would require BeyondATC to inject its own pushback tug into the simulator, which might be considered later as an update. Keep in mind that the dev team will focus on core features before considering cosmetic enhancements. </p> What features are available with AI Traffic? <ul> <li>A custom built injector just for BeyondATC using a comprehensive 3D simulation of every plane's logic and movement.</li> <li>Flight operations from all over the world, boasting over 1 million+ flights from every part of the globe.</li> <li>Gate-accurate airlines for every airport.</li> <li>Airframe performance calculations, meaning each airframe type will takeoff, land, bank, and pitch according to its performance characteristics.</li> <li>Full integration of traffic into the ATC system. All aircraft and ATC will call in and make requests for every stage of flight, accurate to its real world flight plan using the same system as the player.</li> <li>Aircraft agnostic preferencing - BeyondATC doesn't know the difference between the player's aircraft and traffic meaning it will handle and prioritize your plane in the same way it does traffic making for a very realistic simulation of action priority.</li> <li>Taxi logic which will reserve paths along the airport and give way to passing aircraft, resulting in many fewer \"standoff situations\" than default traffic where aircraft will end up facing each other along a taxiway, unable to move.</li> <li>Runway logic and simulation, aircraft are told to line up, hold short, cross runways (with a higher priority the longer they are waiting) and are given clearance according to a deep runway logic simulation. Runway simulation accounts for wake turbulence according to airframe, waiting for vortices to clear before releasing an aircraft for takeoff. An aircraft will be warned of wake turbulence if the preceding aircraft is of a larger airframe than its own.</li> <li>\"Bird's Eye Airport Logic\" where each controller of an airport has situational awareness of what's happening in other sectors of the airport, coordinating their actions according to others situations.</li> <li>Full traffic representation for all stages of flight; clearance, pushback, taxi, takeoff, departure, center, approach, landing, taxi in, shut down.</li> <li>Traffic go arounds: traffic will be told to go around if the landing runway is occupied or unsafe. The traffic then flies the full vectored circuit back to the IAF where it will attempt another landing. The player will also be told to go around if traffic is on the runway or the runway deemed unsafe.</li> <li>Multi-Frequency airport comms: airports are broken up into multiple comm frequencies as determined by custom ops data. This keeps comms clear and contextual to which runway the comm is assigned. (Data for this feature is continuing to be expanded. Currently we have data for about 25 airports).</li> <li>Airplane sequencing, aircraft will be sequenced in to maintain a distance between them according to their speed and airframe. The player is included in these calculations. </li> <li>Pushback tugs, tugs will pushback the aircraft from the gate.</li> <li>Custom takeoff and landing animations, these animations are custom built per airframe. Aircraft will flare on landing, and pitch up before lifting off on takeoff. We believe no other traffic injector, including the MS default injector matches the quality and breadth of these animations.</li> <li>Full integration of traffic into the local BeyondATC airport map, and a wider view enroute traffic map which can be downloaded here.</li> </ul> How do I set up everything to use traffic with BeyondATC? <p>Please follow our setup guide here</p> Can traffic backtrack on a runway? <p>At the moment, traffic cannot backtrack on a runway.
